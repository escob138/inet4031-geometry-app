# INET4031 Geometry Calculator Web Application

This repository contains my completed version of the Geometry Calculator Flask Web Application used in **INET 4031 — Introduction to Systems**.  
The project demonstrates how to build a modular Python Flask application using HTML templates, routes, virtual environments, and unit testing.

This project was originally provided as a partially completed Flask app by the instructor.  
My task was to review how the application works and then fully implement missing components for the **Sphere** calculator.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The Geometry App is a Flask-based web application that calculates the volumes of geometric shapes.  
The instructor provided a working implementation for **Cylinder**, and my job was to extend the application to support **Sphere**.

The project demonstrates skills in:

- Flask web development  
- HTML templates  
- Python modules  
- Software design patterns  
- Unit testing (`unittest`)  
- GitHub repository setup and management  
- Virtual environment usage

## 🧪 **My Completed Tasks**

### ✔ 1. **Implemented Sphere Volume Calculator (`sphere.py`)**
I added:
- `volume(radius)` function  
- `prompt()` standalone mode  
- Input validation (int conversion)  
- Matching structure to `cylinder.py`

### ✔ 2. **Created `sphere.html` Template**
- Matched the design and layout of `cylinder.html`
- Added form fields with names expected by Flask
- Ensured form POSTs correctly to `/sphere`

### ✔ 3. **Completed Flask Route in `GeometryCalcWeb.py`**
- Fixed `/sphere` route to call the proper function in `sphere.py`
- Returned output similar to cylinder implementation
- Fixed redirect from home page

### ✔ 4. **Wrote Automated Unit Tests (`spheretest.py`)**
- Added three test cases:
  - radius 1
  - radius 3
  - radius 10  
- Verified formula correctness using `math.pi`

### ✔ 5. **Created & Pushed Project to GitHub**
- Created repo  
- Added .gitignore  
- Copied instructor files except `.venv`  
- Successfully committed and pushed

## ▶️ **How to Run the Application**

### **1. Create a Virtual Environment**
Windows:
py -3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
### **2. Install Flask**
### **3. Run the App**
Open browser and visit:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
## 🧪 Running Unit Tests

Inside the project directory:
python -m unittest spheretest.py
You should see:
